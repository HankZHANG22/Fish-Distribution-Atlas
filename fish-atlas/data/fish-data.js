---

## Fishing Spot Selection

### Lake Fishing
- **Weed beds** in 2-15 feet of water — pike's primary ambush zones
- **Rocky points** and underwater structure
- **Drop-offs** where shallow water meets deep water
- **Weedy points** and mid-bay weed shoals
- **Cabbage beds** with access to deeper water (holds biggest specimens)

### River Fishing
- **Weir pools** — well-oxygenated with collected natural food
- **Eddies** and slack water areas out of main current
- **Undercut banks** and tree roots sprawling into water
- **Bridges and moored boats** — provide cover and shade
- **Lock entrances** — full of oxygen and natural food

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Early Spring (Ice-out):** Shallow, dark-bottomed bays that warm quickly; creek mouths, flooded timber
- **Late Spring:** Weedy points, 3-10 feet flats, first significant structure points
- **Summer:** Deeper weed edges 8-15 feet, deep cabbage beds, windblown shorelines
- **Fall:** Return to shallower structures, rocky drop-offs
- **Winter:** Deeper water, slow presentations near bottom

> **Pro Tip:** Pike are lie-in-wait predators. Find the vegetation, find the pike. They attack with rocket-like speed — up to 10-15 feet per second!

---

| **Winter** | 1-3m+ | 4-10°C | Deep slow pools, minimal feeding |

### Daily Activity Pattern

| Time | Activity | Best Approach |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Dawn** | Peak feeding | Dry flies, spinners |
| **Midday** | Shaded lies, selective | Nymphs, small spinners |
| **Dusk** | Active surface feeding | Dry flies, emergers |
| **Night** | Minimal activity | Not recommended |

---

## Fishing Spot Selection

### Mountain Stream Fishing
- **Current seams & pocket water** — edges where fast and slow water meet
- **Undercut banks & root systems** — overhead cover
- **Riffle-pool transitions** — head and tail of pools
- **Logjams & overhead vegetation** — shade and protection
- **Spring mouths & tributary confluences** — cooler, stable water

### Lake Fishing (landlocked populations)
- **Inflowing streams** — during hatches or spawning
- **Rocky points & drop-offs** — feeding lanes
- **Submerged springs** — thermal refuges in warm months

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Spring & Early Summer:** Classic lies in main current, excellent dry fly time
- **Mid-Summer:** Low-light periods, deep shaded pools, coldwater inputs
- **Autumn:** Cooling water triggers activity, pre-spawn aggression
- **Winter:** Deepest, slowest pools, very slow presentations

> **Pro Tip:** Yamame are extremely sight-oriented and wary. Stealthy approach and natural presentations are essential!

## Seasonal Water Layer Guide

![Seasonal Water Layer](images/giant-trevally-seasonal-layers.jpg)

*Diagram showing preferred water depths across four seasons*

### Depth Usage by Season

| Season | Depth | Water Temp | Behavior |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Winter/Spring** | 0-20m | 22-28°C | Surface hunting, flats patrol |
| **Summer/Autumn** | 0-72m | 21-34°C | Variable depth, "tropical submergence" |
| **Spawning** | 20-40m | 26-30°C | Deep channels, full moon aggregations |

### Daily Activity Pattern (Diel Vertical Migration)

| Time | Depth | Activity | Best Approach |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Dawn** | 0-20m | Peak feeding | Poppers, stickbaits |
| **Midday** | 30-40m | Deeper, resting | Jigging, deep stickbaits |
| **Dusk** | 0-20m | Active feeding | Poppers, stickbaits |
| **Night** | 50-60m+ | Deep, less active | Not recommended |

---

## Fishing Spot Selection

### Reef Fishing
- **Reef edges and drop-offs** — where shallow meets deep
- **Coral bommies** — isolated coral heads attract baitfish
- **Current breaks** — areas where current splits
- **Exposed reef in surf zone** — GTs hunt in breaking waves
- **Channels between reefs** — natural funnels for baitfish

### Flats Fishing
- **Sandy flats** — GTs patrol for crabs and baitfish
- **Shallow lagoons** — sight fishing opportunities
- **Turtle grass beds** — abundant prey species

### Key Conditions
- **Strong current** is essential — "no run, no fun"
- **Dawn and dusk** — peak feeding times
- **Incoming tide** — brings baitfish onto flats
- **Choppy water** — GTs more aggressive

> **Pro Tip:** GTs are "lazy" predators — they position just outside strong current to ambush disoriented baitfish.

---

## Diet & Feeding Behavior

**Primary Diet:**
- Fish (primary prey)
- Crustaceans (crabs, spiny lobsters)
- Cephalopods (squid, octopus)
- Even small birds and turtles!

**Feeding Characteristics:**
- Apex predator — attacks anything that fits in mouth
- Primarily nocturnal feeders
- Hunt in packs when young, solitary when large
- Explosive, aggressive strikes
- Respond well to popper noise

---

## Reproduction

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Spawning Location | Shallow seaward reefs, offshore banks |
| Spawning Season | Summer, linked to full moon |
| Maturity Size | ~60 cm |
| Behavior | Schooling during spawning aggregations |

**Spawning Behavior:**
- Large aggregations during full moon
- Deep channels and reef passes
- Large individuals (30+ kg) typically solitary
- Hybrid with Bluefin Trevally found in Hawaii

### Surface Breathing Pattern

Toman must surface to breathe every 5-10 minutes — watch for:
- Distinctive "gulp" sound
- Rings on the water surface
- Fry balls (breeding season)

> **Pro Tip:** Look for fry balls — tiny fish at surface = aggressive parents nearby!

---

## Fishing Spot Selection

### Prime Locations
- **Floating vegetation** — water hyacinth, lily pads, grass mats
- **Submerged timber** — fallen trees, stumps, branches
- **Overhanging structures** — trees, docks, bridges
- **Small alcoves and pockets** — ambush points
- **River/drain inlets** — oxygenated water
- **Temple release ponds** — abundant food creates giants

### How to Find Toman
1. **Watch for surface rises** — breathing every 5-10 minutes
2. **Look for fry balls** — parents nearby
3. **Use polarized sunglasses** — reduce glare
4. **Listen for the "gulp"** — distinctive breathing sound

### Approach Tips
- Be stealthy — they spook easily
- Cast beyond target, retrieve INTO strike zone
- Cast onto bank/vegetation, pull lure into water

---

## Diet & Feeding Behavior

**Primary Diet:**
- Fish (main prey)
- Crustaceans
- Frogs
- Small mammals
- Even small birds!

**Feeding Characteristics:**
- Apex predator — extremely aggressive
- Will scavenge, bite large fish in half
- Ambush predator near structure

## Seasonal Water Layer Guide

![Seasonal Water Layer](images/mandarin-fish-seasonal-layers.jpg)

*Diagram showing preferred water depths across four seasons*

### Depth Usage by Season

| Season | Depth | Water Temp | Behavior |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Spring** | 1-5m | 10-18°C | Moving to shallows, increasing activity |
| **Summer** | 2-8m | 18-25°C | Shallow at night, deep shade by day |
| **Autumn** | 2-6m | 12-20°C | Peak feeding, preparing for winter |
| **Winter** | 5-15m+ | 4-10°C | Deep holes, reduced activity, clustered |

### Daily Activity Pattern

| Time | Activity | Best Approach |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Dawn** | Moderate activity | Soft plastics, slow bottom |
| **Daytime** | Resting in ambush position | Very slow, bottom-bouncing |
| **Dusk** | Increasing activity | Soft plastics, VIB |
| **Night** | Peak feeding | Live bait, slow retrieve |

> **Key Insight:** Mandarin Fish are primarily nocturnal feeders. They lie motionless during the day, camouflaged among rocks and debris, then actively hunt at night.

---

## Fishing Spot Selection

### River & Stream Fishing
- **Rocky areas and boulder piles** — primary ambush zones
- **Crevices and caves** — hiding spots
- **Undercut banks** — shaded ambush points
- **Current breaks** — behind large rocks, bridge pilings
- **Areas near rapids or weirs** — well-oxygenated, attracts baitfish

### Lake & Reservoir Fishing
- **Submerged structure** — fallen trees, branches, root systems
- **Rocky drop-offs** — transitions between depths
- **Dense vegetation edges** — summer shade refuges
- **Inlet areas** — food-rich, oxygenated water
- **Deep holes** — winter concentration points

### Key Conditions
- **Clear water** is preferred — Mandarin Fish are sight hunters
- **Areas with abundant small fish** — where prey congregates
- **Complex bottom structure** — the more "snaggy," the better
- **Night fishing** often most productive

> **Pro Tip:** Mandarin Fish are ambush predators that rarely chase prey. They camouflage themselves and wait for food to come within striking range. Find the structure, find the fish!

---

## Diet & Feeding Behavior

**Primary Diet:**
- Small fish (primary — diurnal species with good color vision)
- Shrimp
- Occasionally crayfish

**Feeding Characteristics:**
- **Obligate live prey feeder** — will NOT eat dead or stationary bait
- Typical stalking predator using vision to track prey
- Ambush attack style — explosive strike from hiding
- Prey detection range: 5-10cm, horizontal visual field ~310°
- Will attack prey up to 70-80% of own body length
- Cannibalistic when hungry or food-scarce

**Feeding Behavior:**
- Lies motionless, perfectly camouflaged among structure
- When prey approaches within range, strikes with explosive speed
- Prefers daytime-active fish species (targets their blind period at night)

### Retrieve Technique

1. **Cast to structure** — target rocks, logs, vegetation edges
2. **Let sink to bottom** — feel the lure touch down
3. **Slow hop/drag** — small lifts and pauses
4. **Detect the bite** — sharp "thump" or line movement
5. **Set hook firmly** — pause briefly, then sweep set

> **Strike Detection:** Mandarin Fish typically give one decisive bite and move off. Watch for sudden line tension or rod tip pulling down.

## Conservation Status

| Assessment | Status |
|------------|--------|
| IUCN Red List | Data Deficient (DD) |
| Previous Status | Vulnerable (VU A4cd) - 2007 |
| Assessment Date | November 20, 2016 |
| CITES | Not Evaluated |
| CMS | Not Evaluated |
| Threat to Humans | Harmless |

**Conservation Concerns:**
- **Naturally rare** — always uncommon even in pristine habitats
- **High value** — prized in live fish food trade (especially Hong Kong/Southeast Asia)
- **Aquarium trade** — juveniles heavily collected
- **Slow growth** — vulnerable to overfishing
- **Habitat loss** — coral reef degradation impacts populations

**Conservation Measures:**
- **Australia:** No-take species on Great Barrier Reef; strict possession limits in Western Australia
- **Torres Strait:** Size limits in commercial reef line fishery
- **Indonesia:** Hatchery production established (since 1999)
- Recommended: Size limits, no-take areas, effort controls

> **Note:** While aquaculture production exists, captive breeding has NOT reduced fishing pressure on wild populations — hatchery fish go to aquarium trade and food markets, not stock enhancement.

## Overview

**Beluga** (*Huso huso*), also known as **Great Sturgeon**, is the world's largest sturgeon species and the largest freshwater fish in Europe. This magnificent anadromous fish is critically endangered and renowned for producing the world's most expensive caviar. Distinguished by its enormous size, upturned snout, and interrupted lower lip, Beluga once thrived in the Caspian, Black, and Azov Sea basins but now faces extinction in the wild.

> Etymology: *Huso*: Medieval Latin and Old High German word for sturgeon (Scharpf 2024); *huso*: repeated genus name

> Also called: Great Sturgeon, European Sturgeon, Белуга (Beluga - Russian)

---

## Culinary Notes

Due to its **Critically Endangered conservation status**, consumption of wild Beluga is **strictly prohibited and illegal worldwide**:

**Wild Beluga Products:**
- **Wild caviar** — illegal, drives species toward extinction
- **Wild meat** — illegal, protected by international law
- **Poached products** — severe criminal penalties for possession or trade

**Legal Alternatives:**
- **Aquaculture Beluga caviar** — from certified farms only, requires CITES documentation
- **Bester caviar** — hybrid (*H. huso* × *A. ruthenus*), sustainable and legal
- **Other sturgeon caviar** — from legal aquaculture sources

**Beluga Caviar (historical/aquaculture):**
- Light grey to black color, large eggs
- Buttery, delicate flavor
- Most expensive caviar (historically $3,000-$35,000/kg for wild)
- Only purchase with proper CITES certification

**Meat (aquaculture only):**
- White, firm flesh
- Rich flavor
- Prepared fresh, smoked, frozen
- Broiled, boiled, fried, or baked

> **Critical:** Never purchase wild Beluga caviar or meat. Only buy from certified aquaculture with proper documentation. Illegal trade directly contributes to species extinction.

## Identification Tips

### Beluga vs. Other European Sturgeons

| Feature | Beluga | Russian Sturgeon | Sterlet |
|---------|--------|------------------|---------|
| Max size | 800 cm, 3,200 kg | 235 cm, 115 kg | 125 cm, 16 kg |
| Snout | Moderate, upturned | Long, pointed | Long, pointed, upturned |
| Barbels | Large, leaf-like, reach mouth | Slender, fringed | Fringed |
| Lower lip | **Interrupted at center** | Continuous | Continuous |
| Dorsal scutes | 11-14 | 8-18 | 12-17 |
| Lateral scutes | 41-52 | 24-50 | 56-71 |
| Ventral scutes | 9-11 | 6-14 | 12-16 |

### Key Identification Summary
1. **Enormous size** — far larger than any other European sturgeon (up to 800cm, 3,200kg)
2. **Interrupted lower lip** — discontinuous at center (unique among European sturgeons)
3. **Large, leaf-like barbels** — oval or flat posteriorly, reaching almost to mouth
4. **Moderate, upturned snout** — not extremely long like other sturgeons
5. **41-52 lateral scutes** — specific count range
6. **Ash-grey or greenish back** — white belly

### Quick Field Check
**STEP 1:** Assess size
- Over 3 meters or 100+ kg = Almost certainly Beluga
- Under 2 meters = Likely other sturgeon species

**STEP 2:** Check lower lip
- Interrupted at center = Beluga ✓
- Continuous = Other sturgeon species

**STEP 3:** Examine barbels
- Large, leaf-like, almost reach mouth = Beluga ✓
- Slender or fringed = Other species

> **Important:** If you identify a wild Beluga, immediately contact conservation authorities. Do not attempt to handle or disturb the fish. Record location, take photos if possible (from distance), and report sighting.

| **Midday** | Moderate activity, structure-bound | Deep jigging, slow presentations |
| **Dusk** | Active feeding resumes | Live/cut bait, jigs near structure |
| **Night** | Resting in cover | Less productive than daylight |

> **Key Insight:** Orange-spotted Grouper are primarily diurnal feeders with peak activity at dawn and dusk. Target turbid coastal reefs and estuaries during tidal movements.

---

## Fishing Spot Selection

### Coastal & Reef Fishing
- **Turbid coastal reefs** — primary adult habitat, preferred over clear water
- **Reef edges and drop-offs** — transition zones
- **Rocky ledges and caves** — ambush points
- **Rubble and mud bottoms** — near structure
- **Channel systems** — tidal flow areas

### Brackish Water & Estuary Fishing
- **River mouths** — where freshwater meets saltwater
- **Mangrove-lined channels** — juvenile and adult habitat
- **Tidal creeks** — focus on structure
- **Estuarine flats** — sand, mud, gravel during high tide
- **Bridge pilings** — in brackish zones

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Spring (Pre-spawn):** Moving to aggregation sites, excellent fishing
- **Summer (Spawn):** Aggregations form, target carefully (conservation)
- **Autumn (Post-spawn):** Feeding heavily, widespread distribution
- **Winter (Cold season):** Deeper water, slower action in cooler areas

> **Pro Tip:** Orange-spotted Grouper's tolerance of brackish water sets them apart from most groupers. Target estuaries that other anglers overlook for consistent action.

## Overview

**Brown-marbled Grouper** (*Epinephelus fuscoguttatus*), also known as **Flowery Cod** or **Flowery Rockcod**, is a large Indo-Pacific grouper distinguished by its distinctive marbled pattern of dark brown blotches and close-set brown spots. One of the most commercially important groupers in the region, this species is highly valued in live fish markets and is considered vulnerable due to fishing pressure on spawning aggregations.

> Etymology: *Epinephelus* (Greek: cloudy) + *fuscoguttatus* (Latin: dark-spotted)

> Also called: Flowery Cod, Flowery Rockcod, Marbled Grouper, Flowery Grouper
